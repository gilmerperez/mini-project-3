# Rock, Paper, Scissors

## Description

This project involves building a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors using only JavaScript. Users can play against an automated opponent, track their results, and analyze their choices.

## Instructions

The application should meet the following criteria:

* Users can enter **R**, **P**, or **S** to signify their choice of rock, paper, or scissors.
* The computer's choice is randomly generated for a fair game.
* Users will be prompted if they enter an invalid choice.
* After each round, users have the option to play again.
* At the end of the game, users can view their total wins, losses, ties, and how many times they chose each option.

## Key Features

* **Player Input:** Users can input their choice via `prompt()`.
* **Random Computer Choice:** The computer generates a random choice using JavaScript's `Math.random`.
* **Game Tracking:** Tracks total wins, ties, and losses for the player.
* **Detailed Statistics:** Displays the count of each user choice (e.g., how many times they chose rock, paper, or scissors).
* **Replay Option:** Allows users to play multiple rounds.

## Technology Stack

This project uses the following technologies:

* **JavaScript:** Powers the game logic, random choice generation, and user interaction.
* **Browser Alerts and Prompts:** Utilizes `alert()`, `prompt()`, and `confirm()` for user interaction.
